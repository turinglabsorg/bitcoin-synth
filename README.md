# üéµ Bitcoin Crazy Synth üéµ

## What's this all about?

Ever wanted to hear what the blockchain sounds like? No? Well, too bad! Now it's even crazier! üéπ

This project turns Bitcoin transactions into wild, harmonized, mood-swinging synth jams. It's like a DJ, a mad scientist, and a blockchain node all got stuck in a synth together. üéß

## Features

- üéº Turn real Bitcoin transactions into sick, evolving beats
- üéπ Harmonized melodies: now with thirds, fifths, and octaves for extra musical mayhem
- üéµ Dynamic moods: the music gets happier or sadder based on the real-time BTC price (yes, your portfolio can literally change the tune)
- üï∫ Melodies are more dynamic than your favorite jazz soloist
- üéöÔ∏è Sliders for tempo, mood, and musical key (because you're the maestro)
- ü•Å Ambient synth backgrounds that know when to chill
- üñºÔ∏è OpenGraph & Twitter Card support for beautiful social sharing
- üö´ Right-click disabled (no peeking at the blockchain's secret recipe)
- üî• Live transaction display and raw hex for the true blockchain nerds
- ü§ñ Press SPACE or hit Next to jump to a new transaction and remix the chain
